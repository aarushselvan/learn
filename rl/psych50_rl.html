	<h2>Reinforcement learning lab</h2>
	<p>This final lab is focused on helping you understand the reinforcement learning models we use in cognitive neuroscience. We want you to both realize their usefuleness but also their inherent limitations. Learning is complex--and reinforcement learning is able to capture many forms of learning, such as operant conditioning tasks, but fail at one-shot learning tasks. There's an entire field now dedicated to reinforcement learning but we're going to focus narrowly on just one specific idea: that you can estimate the <b>value</b> of an action by comparing your prediction against reality over and over.</p>
	<h1>Learning goals</h1>
	After this lab you should have a better understanding of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>How reinforcement learning solves the computational goal of "supervised learning".</li>
		<li>Why the Rescorla-Wagner algorithm works for simple reinforcement learning.</li>
		<li>Examples of situations in which reinforcement learning fails to fully account for behavior.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Demo</h2>
	<p>The first part of this tutorial is a live demonstration of reinforcement learning in action. You will take on the role of a squirrel, your goal is to fatten yourself up to survive the Palo Alto winter. We all know how bad it can get, so collect a lot of apples! There will be three trees, each of which drops apples. Search around to find the best tree... good luck!</p>
	<p>Head over to: <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">our local forest</a> to get started on the demo. Your TA will tell you which section to join.</p>
</div>

<div id="block3">
	<h2>Verbal model</h2>
	<p>Along with your class you should have had a discussion about a verbal model of learning in the apple hoarding task. Your model should have ended up being something like: "I keep an estimate of how many apples each tree drops in my mind. I pick a tree to go to and compare how many apples I get against what I expected. I adjust up or down accordingly". This is the verbal model that we're now going to translate into a computational one.</p>
	<p>We've done this before so we're now going to dig into more of the details than we have in past computational models. The first thing to do here is to take the computational goal we've described (the verbal model) and turn it into a mathematical equation. This is important: the implementation we're going to use is javascript, a programming language, and javascript relies on our algorithm being in formal mathematical terms.</p>
	<p>The first part of our verbal model was: <b>keep an estimate of how many apples each tree drops</b>. For simplicity we're going to just model one tree for now, but what this basically means is that there's some variable that is going to keep track of our <b>knowledge</b> for a particular tree. We'll call this variable A, for apples:</p>
	<div id="katex1"></div>
	<p>A starts at zero because initially we don't know anything about trees and we're pessimistic. The second part of the verbal model says, I pick a tree and compare how many apples I get against what I expected. Let's call the number of apples you get on each visit R, for <b>reward</b>. We'll call the difference between your knowledge and the reward the <b>reward prediction error</b>:</p>
	<div id="katex2"></div>
	<p>Notice that we indexed A with a little <b>v</b>? That's because we're now talking about a specific visit. Your knowledge about how many apples a tree drops is going to change over time so we need to be specific about when exactly we're talking about. Before we go on let's think about the reward prediction error for a bit.</p>
</div>

<div id="block4">
	<h2>Reward prediction error</h2>
	<p>To help you get a sense for how prediction error is useful let's simulate just a single tree. On each step we're going to let you make a guess of how many apples will fall and then check your answer. We won't tell you how many apples actually fell, we're just going to tell you whether the <b>prediction error</b> was positive (more apples fell than you expected) or negative. The point of this demo is simply to reinforce the idea that you don't need absolute knowledge to do well at estimating something's value, as long as you can integrate information over time. This should remind you of a similar story we heard about LIP neurons and MT!</p>

<div id="block5">
	<h2>Rescorla-Wagner</h2>
	<p>The complete model that we've now built up looks as follows:</p>

	<h2>Multiple trees</h2>
</div>

<div id="block7">
	<h2>Other sources of information?</h2>
	<p>You've now seen how reinforcement learning can be used to explain your behavior in the task you performed earlier. But what we hid from you in the task was that all the students in the room were doing the task together! What if you could all see each other? How would that additional social information change your behavior?

	<h2>Tutorial complete!</h2>
	<p> Your TAs would be happy to discuss any aspect of the tutorial. As a reminder, you should now have a better understanding of the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How reinforcement learning solves the computational goal of "supervised learning".</li>
			<li>An example algorithm used for simple reinforcement learning.</li>
			<li>Examples of situations in which reinforcement learning fails to fully account for behavior.</li>
